    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Panko breadcrumbs</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Black pepper</li>
        <li>Chicken breast</li>
        <li>Oil</li>
        <li>Garlic</li>
        <li>Tomato sauce</li>
        <li>Mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>Spaghetti</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese, and pepper in a large zip-top bag.
             Shake each chicken breast in the bag to coat; transfer to a plate.</li>
        <li>Heat oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. Add chicken 
            breasts and cook until browned, 6 to 10 minutes, turning once. Pour 
            tomato cooking sauce around chicken, then sprinkle remaining bread 
            crumb mixture and mozzarella cheese over top; bring to a boil. Cover, 
            reduce the heat to medium, and cook until cheese is melted and chicken 
            is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at 
            least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </li>
        <li>While the chicken is cooking, cook spaghetti in a large pot of boiling 
            water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 
            12 minutes. Drain. </li>
        <li>Serve chicken and sauce over spaghetti. </li>
    </ol>
